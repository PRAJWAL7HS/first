                        Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet in the Solar System. 
                        Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological 
                        features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produces by a period of contraction 
                        early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its 
                        surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet 
                        been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off 
                        by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.

                            <p class="lead">Venus is close in size to Earth and, like Earth, has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, 
                                a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, 
                                and its atmosphere is ninety times as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, 
                                with surface temperatures over 400 °C (752 °F), most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in 
                                the atmosphere. No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus, but it 
                                has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere, which suggests that its 
                                atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.

                                from those of other planets, having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen. It has one

                                Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red 
                                colour comes from iron oxide in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites Deimos and Phobos thought to be 
                                either captures asteroids, or ejected debris from a massive impact early in Mars's history.

                                at 95 M. Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water. The rings of Saturn are 
                                made up of small ice and rock particles. Saturn has 62 confirmed satellites composed largely of ice. Two of
