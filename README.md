# Solar
Basic web page created about the Solar System. Using html, css, and bootstrap with a bit of javascript.

This was my first project in web development. I created this website to display fun information about our Solar System. I created responsive website using Bootstrap4 especially their grid system. The most challenging aspect of this project for my was getting the pictures of the planets all the right size and getting them to grow/shrink with respect to the window.
